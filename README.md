### Hi there üëã I'm Marcos

I am a software engineer and tech lead with 13+ years of professional experience, driven by a passion for inspiring those around me and fostering exceptional work environments. My goal as a leader is to create not just high-performing teams, but also strong human connections, built on friendship, trust, and mutual respect. I believe that cultivating a positive culture leads to teams that are both passionate about their work and relentless in their pursuit of excellence.

Throughout my career, I‚Äôve refused to be just another name on the roster. In every organization I‚Äôve been a part of, I‚Äôve made a meaningful impact‚Äîwhether by elevating companies to new heights, delivering products that have stood the test of time, or empowering teams to achieve their full potential. My journey has been one of creating value that lasts, leaving behind not just results but a legacy of growth and collaboration.
